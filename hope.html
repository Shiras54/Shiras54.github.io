                    <p>The Hope spacecraft will be a compact, hexagonal-section spacecraft. It will be built from <strong>aluminium</strong> in a stiff but lightweight honeycomb structure and surfaced with a strong composite face-sheet. Its overall size and weight are comparable to a small car: it will weigh approximately 1,500 kg including fuel, and measure 2.37m wide by 2.90m tall.</p>
                    <p>Once in space the craft will charge its <strong>batteries</strong> using three 600-watt <strong>solar panels</strong>. (For comparison, that is enough power to run around 20 laptop computers). The solar panel arrays will be folded flat against the sides of the spacecraft&nbsp;for launch, and will unfold once the ​spacecraft&nbsp;is in orbit.</p>

                <div class="item">
                    <p>Hope will communicate with Mission Control on earth using a <strong>high-gain antenna</strong> with a 1.5m wide dish. This antenna will produce a narrow radio-wave beam that must point directly at Earth in order to make contact. Hope will also have low-gain antennas, which are less directional.</p>
                    <p>Communication bandwidth will drop from 1.6mbs to 250kbps as the probe journeys further from Earth (equivalent to cell-phone data speeds).</p>
                    <p>Hope will be equipped with <strong>star tracker</strong> sensors that will help it to determine its position in space by studying the constellations in relation to the sun.<br /></p>

                <div class="item">
                    <p>It will be equipped with <strong>two sets of rocket thrusters:</strong> four to six large &ldquo;Delta V&rdquo; thrusters which are used to speed up and slow down, and eight to 12 small Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters for delicate manoeuvring.</p>
                    <p>From time to time Hope will need to reorient itself, for instance to point its solar panels at the sun, to point its antenna at Earth, or to point its scientific instruments at Mars. For this purpose it will use a set of internal <strong>reaction wheels &ndash;</strong> flywheels that are spun to create momentum that rotates the spacecraft precisely around any axis.</p>

                <div class="item">
                    <p>Hope's brain is a computer equipped with sophisticated software that can manoeuvre it into Mars orbit autonomously without human guidance from Earth. This is important because by the time Hope reaches Mars, there will be a 13-20 minute communication delay due to the huge distance involved, and this will prevent real-time communication and control.</p>
                    <p>Hope carries three scientific instruments for its mission to study the Martian atmosphere:</p>

                <p class="biggerp">
                    The spacecraft is set to arrive at Mars in 2021 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the founding of the UAE.<br>
                    The rocket must blast off from Earth during a brief “launch window” in July 2020.  This is because the Earth and Mars orbit the Sun at different rates, and are aligned at their closest point only once every two years. If any part of the mission is not ready in time or fails at the last minute, there may be no second chance. </p>
