                    <p class="biggerp">As the first-ever Arab Islamic mission to another planet, the project demonstrates the capability of the Arab people as contributors to humanity and civilisation. It proves that optimism, confidence and ambition can deliver the greatest achievements no matter the place. It is a symbol of hope for a new era of peaceful human development. It will inspire a young generation to think positively and see a future filled with possibility. </p>

                        The mission is planned, managed and executed by a team here in the UAE. They will do it the hard way: key technologies will be designed, built and assembled locally, not imported. Technical knowledge will be developed in the UAE and transferred through collaboration with partners, not outsourced. <br>
                        This approach ensures that the mission will leave behind a valuable and enduring legacy in the form of human capital: a generation of experienced scientists and engineers trained and inspired by the Mars mission.

                    The UAE government sees the Red Planet project as a turning point in the nationâ€™s development. It will establish the space technology sector as a key economic sector for years to come. The UAE aims to be among the top countries worldwide in the field of space technology by the time the orbiter arrives at Mars in 2021.<br>
                    Globally, space technologies are becoming increasingly important to the security and economy of nations, in many cases backed by massive national programmes and institutions. The sector is integral to many aspects of life from telecommunications and navigation to broadcasting and monitoring of weather and natural disasters.<br>
                    The industry is estimated to be worth around $300 billion globally and growing by around 8% annually. The Mars mission will be an anchor project for a new space technology industry here in the UAE.
