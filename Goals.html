                            The Emirates Mars Mission team has coordinated closely with the global Mars science community from the outset in order to identify gaps in human knowledge that no other missions have studied. In this way, it will provide answers to the global scientific community’s most pressing questions about Mars. This process has been managed through the international Mars Exploration Program and Analysis Group. <br>
                            Specifically, the Emirates Mars Mission will be the first probe to study climate throughout daily and seasonal cycles – previous probes took snapshots only at a certain time of day. It will be Mars’s first true weather satellite. It will the be the first to study the effects that events in the lower atmosphere, such as changes in temperature and dust storms, can have in the upper atmosphere days or weeks later. It will be the first to examine the interaction between climate and geography, such as links and differences between weather on the peaks of Mars’s massive volcanoes and in the depths of its canyons.

                            Today, almost all of our understanding of climate comes from scientific studies of the atmosphere here on Earth. Mars is a valuable laboratory for atmosphere science because conditions there are very different. The insights and data we gain from understanding the Martian climate will add new dimensions to human knowledge about how atmospheres work. This is important not just for Mars and Earth, but also for the millions of other potentially habitable planets recently discovered in our galaxy. Studying the atmosphere on Mars will help scientists evaluate distant worlds for conditions that might support life.

                            The spacecraft will collect and send back to Earth over 1000 gigabytes of new Mars data. This information will be received in the Science Data Center in the UAE via different ground stations spread around the world. These never-seen-before data will be catalogued and analysed in the UAE by the Emirates Mars Mission science team, and then shared freely with the international Mars science community as a service to human knowledge.<br>
                            The data will be used by thousands of members of the world science community for many years to come in ways that, today, we cannot even begin to imagine. Faculty, research scientists, postdocs, and students worldwide will use these findings to better understand planetary and climate development throughout our solar system and, ultimately, to further our understanding of Earth’s place in the Universe.
